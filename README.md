A collection of dev tools I'm working on! I bundled these together based on my day-to-day needs at work.

- Regex Pattern Recognizer: a tool for quickly testing and experimenting with regular expressions in real time
  - I sometimes need to use regex patterns at work when working with data, and this tools lets me quickly find the patterns in a set of text
- Diff Checker (WIP): a tool for comparing two text entries side by side to highlight differences
  - Oftentimes I need to compare two bits of text or code and see the difference between them
- Case Converter: converts text / variable names to the desired case
  - Useful for when I have long variable names and am too lazy to convert them all
